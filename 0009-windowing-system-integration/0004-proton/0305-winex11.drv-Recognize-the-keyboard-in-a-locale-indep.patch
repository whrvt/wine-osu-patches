Subject: [PATCH 0305/1562] winex11.drv: Recognize the keyboard in a
 locale-independent way.

Try to recognize the keyboard comparing keysyms instead of converting
them to multibyte strings, which makes the process locale-dependent and
therefore more fragile.

Unfortunately this means that the layout tables might need to be
updated. However, this change is known to fix the recognitions of a few
keys in the French layout.
