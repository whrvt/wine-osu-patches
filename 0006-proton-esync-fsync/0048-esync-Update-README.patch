 WINEESYNC=1 (note that it checks the presence and not the value); debug it
 with +esync.

+Please let me know if you find any bugs. If you can, also attach a log with
++seh,+pid,+esync,+server.
+
+If you get something like "eventfd: Too many open files" and then things start
+crashing, you've probably run out of file descriptors. esync creates one
+eventfd descriptor for each synchronization object, and some games may use a
+large number of these.  Linux by default limits a process to 4096 file
+descriptors, which probably was reasonable back in the nineties but isn't
+really anymore. (Fortunately Debian and derivatives [Ubuntu, Mint] already
+have a reasonable limit.) To raise the limit you'll want to edit

+
+Also note that if the wineserver has esync active, all clients also must, and
+vice versa. Otherwise things will probably crash quite badly.
+
+== EXPLANATION ==
+
 The aim is to execute all synchronization operations in "user-space", that is,
 without going through wineserver. We do this using Linux's eventfd
 facility. The main impetus to using eventfd is so that we can poll multiple

 There are some things that are perfectly implementable but that I just haven't
 done yet:
-* NtQuery*. That said, these APIs aren't exposed through kernel32 in any way, so

 * Other synchronizable server primitives. It's unlikely we'll need any of
   these, except perhaps named pipes (which would honestly be rather difficult)
