+         * that fails, release any resources we've grabbed (and yes, we can

+         * put back, and in both cases we just put back 1), and if any of that

+         *
+         * What makes this inherently bad is that we might temporarily grab a
+         * resource incorrectly. Hopefully it'll be quick (and hey, it won't
+         * block on wineserver) so nobody will notice. Besides, consider: if
+         * object A becomes signaled but someone grabs it before we can grab it
+         * and everything else, then they could just as well have grabbed it
+         * before it became signaled. Similarly if object A was signaled and we
+         * were blocking on object B, then B becomes available and someone grabs
+         * A before we can, then they might have grabbed A before B became
+         * signaled. In either case anyone who tries to wait on A or B will be
+         * waiting for an instant while we put things back. */
